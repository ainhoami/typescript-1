Front end React based application, with Express for the server side.

Basic template to render API calls made on the server side, on the Front end.

## How it works
The app pretends to be a photographers site where all the albums and photos will be displayed.

- We load it at localhost:3000 and we first get the list of the users.

- Then, after we choose one of the users, we get his info and all his albums.

- And we get all the photos contained once an specific album has been chosen.
